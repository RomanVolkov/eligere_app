# Logs

When there is something wrong - it will be written in the log file. <code>Eligere</code> stores log file at your home directory <code>~/.eligere.log</code>. You can find this path form <code>Eligere</code> main view, there is a buttom to copy this path for your machine into clipboard. Also, you can open this log in <code>Console.app</code> via <code>Eligere</code> itself.


Verbosity level for a log depends on your [configuration value](./config.md). By default you will see only <code>error</code> and <code>critical</code> messages, which you would care most of the time.

Using <code>debug</code> mode only makes sense when you need to submit this log to developer when it is needed to solve your issue. Don't use <code>debug</code> all the time as it makes the log way big and consumes a lot of space.
